in September, marking the service’s biggest upgrade yet. Turn any device into a powerhouse gaming rig with GeForce RTX 5080-class performance, next-generation AI features and a major leap forward in stunning cinematic visuals — all without raising membership prices.
With the upgrade to the Blackwell RTX architecture, all Premium members will get access to a new feature called Install-to-Play, which expands the GeForce NOW cloud game catalog to nearly 4,500 titles.
And be on the lookout for an upcoming lineup of this year’s hottest new titles, optimized to take full advantage of the GeForce RTX 5080-gaming rig in the cloud. The list includes
ARC Raiders
,
Borderlands 4
,
Call of Duty: Black Ops 7
,
Cinder City
,
Dying Light: The Beast, Hell Is Us
,
The Outer Worlds 2
,
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2
and more
.
Members will be able to play these blockbuster titles in the cloud when they launch, streaming instantly from their device of choice.
NVIDIA will also be launching GeForce NOW in India this November. It follows Thailand as the latest region to gain access to GeForce NOW through GFNA partner Brothers Picture — enabling even more gamers around the world to experience the future of cloud gaming at the same great membership prices.
Be among the first to tap into GeForce RTX 5080 power from the cloud by upgrading to an Ultimate membership today. Server space will be limited, so be sure to lock it in today.
There’s even more fun to come — check out the list of 13 new games joining the GeForce NOW library this week.
Paint It Blackwell
With the NVIDIA Blackwell RTX architecture, GeForce NOW is beaming GeForce RTX 5080-class power from the cloud straight to nearly any device.
GeForce RTX 5080-class GPUs bring a staggering 62 teraflops of compute performance, a 48GB frame buffer, more than 3x the performance of current consoles and 2.8x faster frame rates than previous-generation servers. Advanced ray tracing, richer textures and AI-enhanced rendering with AMD “Zen 5” CPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX-7 networking deliver an experience that’s more responsive than ever.
It isn’t just raw speed either. NVIDIA Blackwell RTX unlocks:
The highest resolutions and frame rates in the cloud:
NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation unlocks up to 5K streaming at 120 frames per second (fps) — performance once reserved for the most elite PCs.
NVIDIA Reflex
technology levels up the cloud for competitive gaming, delivering streams up to 360 fps at 1080p and network latency under 30 milliseconds.
Vastly improved visual fidelity:
A new Cinematic Quality Streaming mode delivers richer colors, sharper text and crystal-clear scenes with 4:4:4 chroma sampling, AI sharpening and advanced AV1 encoding — even when network conditions change.
GeForce NOW support on more devices:
Premium members will be able to stream at 90 fps on Steam Decks and 4k 120 fps on the Lenovo Legion Go S handheld. Supported LG monitors can stream at up to 5K 120Hz and supported LG TVs at 4K 120Hz — no extra hardware required. Mac users get the full NVIDIA Blackwell RTX upgrade, and there’s expanded support for peripherals like Logitech racing wheels.
Plus, collaborations with Comcast, Deutsche Telekom AG and others bring enhanced broadband and 5G performance.
Ultimate memberships remain at $19.99 a month and Performance memberships at $9.99 a month. With the launch of NVIDIA Blackwell RTX on GeForce NOW, upgraded Ultimate memberships will debut with an unchanged $19.99 a month or $199.99 for 12-month plans.
Newly upgraded Ultimate, who dis?
Double the Games, Double the Fun
The biggest expansion yet for the GeForce NOW game library arrives with the launch of Install-to-Play. This new feature harnesses high-performance cloud storage, powered by NVIDIA NVMesh technology, to allow game installations directly in the cloud.
Members will be able to bring even more of their PC collections to the cloud to play instantly, mirroring the experience of a local PC. Install-to-Play instantly doubles the supported games on GeForce NOW with more than 2,200 Steam titles already opted in for cloud streaming, rocketing the total GeForce NOW library size to over 4,500 accessible games, with more to come.
The game multiplier.
Ultimate and Performance members will have 100GB of single-session storage included, with flexible add-ons for persistent storage — 200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month. Once a game is installed on persistent storage, it remains instantly ready for members to play.
The Ultimate Party
The upgrade to NVIDIA Blackwell RTX in the cloud arrives just in time for some of the year’s top-tier game launches. These highly anticipated titles will be among the first to take full advantage of the upgraded platform’s powerful performance — letting members experience cutting-edge gameplay, ultrahigh resolutions and instant day-one access in the cloud.
The cloud is the best way to play.

Better together.
NVIDIA, Discord and Epic are teaming up to change how games are discovered and played together, making it easier than ever to stay connected to friends through gaming.
Powered by GeForce NOW streaming,
this new integrated experience
— demoed behind closed doors at Gamescom — will let players discover and try new games with friends directly on Discord. They can do so with no downloads or installs, and even without owning the game or a GeForce NOW membership. It’s fueled by a limited-time trial of the GeForce NOW Performance experience for streaming at up 1440p 60 fps — all without needing to leave Discord.
The first game to take advantage of the integrated experience is
Fortnite.
Connecting an Epic account is all it takes to join the action. For Discord’s hundreds of millions of users, it’s a faster, simpler way to discover games and play together where gaming conversations are already happening.
