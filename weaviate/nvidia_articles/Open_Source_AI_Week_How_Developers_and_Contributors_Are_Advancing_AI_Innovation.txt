Building the Future of AI With PyTorch and NVIDIA
ðŸ”—
PyTorch
, the fastest-growing AI framework, derives its performance from the NVIDIA CUDA platform and uses the Python programming language to unlock developer productivity. This year, NVIDIA
added
Python as a first-class language to the CUDA platform, giving the PyTorch developer community greater access to CUDA.
CUDA Python includes key components that make GPU acceleration in Python easier than ever, with built-in support for
kernel fusion
,
extension module integration
and simplified
packaging
for fast deployment.
Following PyTorchâ€™s open collaboration model,
CUDA Python
is available on
GitHub
and
PyPI
.
According to
PyPI Stats
, PyTorch averaged overâ€¯twoâ€¯million daily downloads, peaking atâ€¯2,303,217â€¯onâ€¯Octoberâ€¯14,â€¯andâ€¯had 65â€¯million total downloads last month.
Every month, developers worldwide download
hundreds of millions of
NVIDIA libraries â€” including CUDA, cuDNN, cuBLAS and CUTLASS â€” mostly within Python and PyTorch environments. CUDA Python provides
nvmath-python
, a new library that acts as the bridge between Python code and these highly optimized GPU libraries.
Plus,
kernel enhancements
and support for next-generation frameworks make NVIDIA accelerated computing more efficient, adaptable and widely accessible.
NVIDIA maintains a long-standing collaboration with the PyTorch community through open-source contributions and technical leadership, as well as by sponsoring and participating in community events and activations.
At
PyTorch Conference 2025 in San Francisco
, NVIDIA will host a keynote address, five technical sessions and nine poster presentations.

NVIDIA Spotlights Open Source Innovation
ðŸ”—
Open Source AI Week
kicks off on Monday with a series of hackathons, workshops and meetups spotlighting the latest advances in AI, machine learning and open-source innovation.
The event brings together leading organizations, researchers and open-source communities to share knowledge, collaborate on tools and explore how openness accelerates AI development.
NVIDIA continues to expand access to advanced AI innovation by providing open-source tools, models and datasets designed to empower developers. With more than 1,000 open-source tools on
NVIDIA GitHub
repositories and over 500 models and 100 datasets on the
NVIDIA Hugging Face
collections, NVIDIA is accelerating the pace of open, collaborative AI development.
Over the past year,
NVIDIA has become the top contributor
in Hugging Face repositories, reflecting a deep commitment to sharing models, frameworks and research that empower the community.

Openly available models, tools and datasets are essential to driving innovation and progress. By empowering anyone to use, modify and share technology, it fosters transparency and accelerates discovery, fueling breakthroughs that benefit both industry and communities alike. Thatâ€™s why NVIDIA is committed to supporting the open source ecosystem.
Weâ€™re on the ground all week â€” stay tuned for a celebration highlighting the spirit of innovation, collaboration and community that drives open-source AI forward, with the
PyTorch Conference
serving as the flagship event.
