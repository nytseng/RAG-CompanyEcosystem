Editor’s note: This blog is a part of
Into the Omniverse
, a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in
OpenUSD
and
NVIDIA Omniverse
.
Investments in
industrial AI
and
physical AI
are driving increased demand for
digital twins
across industries.
These physically accurate, virtual replicas of real-world environments, facilities and processes aren’t just helping manufacturers streamline planning and optimize operations. They serve as the training ground for helping ensure vision AI agents, autonomous vehicles and robot fleets can operate safely, efficiently and reliably.
Creating physically accurate simulation environments that enable physical AI to transition seamlessly to the real world typically involves substantial manual effort. However, with the latest advancements in OpenUSD — a powerful open standard for describing and connecting complex 3D worlds — alongside improvements in rendering, neural reconstruction and
world foundation models (WFMs)
, developers can fast-track the construction of digital twins at scale.
Accelerating Digital Twin and Physical AI Development
To speed digital twin and physical AI development, NVIDIA announced at this year’s SIGGRAPH conference new research, NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, NVIDIA Cosmos WFMs and advanced AI infrastructure — including
NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers
and
NVIDIA DGX Cloud
.
The
latest Omniverse software development kits
bridge MuJoCo and Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), enabling over 250,000 MJCF
robot learning
developers to simulate robots across platforms.
Omniverse NuRec
libraries and AI models enable Omniverse RTX ray-traced
3D Gaussian splatting
, allowing developers to capture, reconstruct and simulate the real world in 3D using sensor data.
NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.0
and
Isaac Lab 2.2
open-source robot simulation and learning frameworks are now available on GitHub.
Isaac Sim
features NuRec neural rendering and new OpenUSD robot and sensor schemas to narrow the simulation-to-reality gap.
Cosmos WFMs, including
Cosmos Transfer-2
and
NVIDIA Cosmos Reason
, deliver leaps in synthetic data generation and reasoning for physical AI development.
NVIDIA research
advances in rendering and AI-assisted material generation help developers scale digital twin development.
Growing OpenUSD Ecosystem
OpenUSD serves as a foundational ecosystem for digital twin and physical AI development, empowering developers to integrate industrial and 3D data to create physically accurate digital twins.
The
Alliance for OpenUSD
(AOUSD) recently welcomed
new general members
, including Accenture, Esri, HCLTech, PTC, Renault and Tech Soft 3D. These additions underscore the continued growth of the OpenUSD community and its commitment to unifying 3D workflows across industries.
To address the growing demand for OpenUSD and digital twins expertise, NVIDIA launched a new industry-recognized
OpenUSD development certification
and a free
digital twins learning path
.
Developers Building Digital Twins
Industry leaders including
Siemens
,
Sight Machine
,
Rockwell Automation
,
EDAG
,
Schaeffler
,
Amazon Devices & Services
and
Vention
are building digital twin solutions with Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD to enable transformation with industrial and physical AI.
Siemens
’ Teamcenter Digital Reality Viewer enables engineers to visualize, interact with and collaborate on photorealistic digital twins at unprecedented scale. These efforts are enabling faster design reviews, minimizing the need for physical prototypes a
Schaeffler

nd accelerating time to market — all while reducing costs.
Sight Machine’s
Operator Agent platform combines live production data, agentic AI-powered recommendations and digital twins to provide real-time visibility into production and enable faster, more informed decisions for plant operations teams.
Rockwell Automation’s
Emulate3D Factory Test platform enables manufacturers to build factory-scale, physics-based digital twins for simulating, validating and optimizing automation and autonomous systems at scale.
EDAG’s
industrial digital twin platform helps manufacturers improve project management, optimize production layouts, train workers and perform data-driven quality assurance.
Schaeffler
built a digital twin platform that integrates critical planning and production data to enable its teams to streamline planning, as well as simulate and optimize plants, machines and workflows.
Amazon Devices & Services
uses digital twins to train robotic arms to recognize, inspect and handle new devices. Robotic actions can be configured to manufacture products purely based on training performed in simulation — including for steps involved in assembly, testing, packaging and auditing.
Vention
is using NVIDIA robotics, AI and simulation technologies — including Omniverse libraries, Isaac Sim and Jetson hardware — to deliver plug-and-play digital twin and automation solutions that simplify and accelerate the deployment of intelligent manufacturing systems.
