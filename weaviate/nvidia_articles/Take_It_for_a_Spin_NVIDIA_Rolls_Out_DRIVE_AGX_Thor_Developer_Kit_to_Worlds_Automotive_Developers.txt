As
autonomous vehicle
systems rapidly grow in complexity, equipped with reasoning vision language action models, generative AI and advanced sensor technologies, developers need tools that are powerful, efficient and built to meet automotive-grade safety requirements.
The NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor developer kit — now available for
preorder
today, with delivery in September — provides developers and researchers worldwide an advanced platform to accelerate the design, testing and deployment of AVs and intelligent mobility solutions.
The developer kit is built on the
NVIDIA Blackwell architecture
, next-generation
Arm Neoverse V3AE CPUs
and the
NVIDIA DriveOS
7 software stack. It’s purpose-built for reasoning vision language action models and ideal for automotive development, with sufficient I/O to support surround cameras, radars and lidars, as well as common vehicle interfaces including GbE/10GbE and PCI-Express. DRIVE AGX Thor also meets the automotive industry’s stringent functional safety (ISO 26262) and cybersecurity requirements (ISO 21434).
The Growing DRIVE AGX Thor Ecosystem
The world’s leading automotive companies are building on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, including
BYD
, GAC, IM Motors,
Li Auto
,
Volvo Cars
, Xiaomi and Zeekr. Autonomous trucking companies building on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor include
Aurora
,
Gatik,
PlusAI
and
Waabi
.
NVIDIA AV partners

AV Safety From Cloud to Car
Designed for automotive-grade safety and security, DRIVE AGX Thor and DriveOS are key elements of
NVIDIA Halos
, a comprehensive safety system that brings together NVIDIA’s automotive hardware and software safety technologies with cutting-edge AI research in AV safety.
Halos offers a holistic approach to automotive safety:
At the technology level, it spans platform, algorithmic and ecosystem safety.
At the development level, it includes design-, deployment- and validation-time guardrails.
At the computational level, it spans AI training to deployment, using three powerful computers —
NVIDIA DGX
for AI training,
NVIDIA Omniverse
and
NVIDIA Cosmos
running on
NVIDIA OVX
for simulation, and
NVIDIA DRIVE AGX
for deployment.
