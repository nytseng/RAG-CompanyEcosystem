GeForce NOW
is packing a monstrous punch this week.
Dying Light: The Beast
, the latest adrenaline‚Äëfueled chapter in Techland‚Äôs parkour‚Äëmeets‚Äësurvival‚Äëhorror saga, is clawing its way into the cloud ‚Äî ready for members to stream instantly.
That‚Äôs just the start. Head back to class with SEGA‚Äôs wacky management simulation games
Two Point Campus
and
Two Point Museum
, then slip into the shadows for the new ‚ÄúClaws of Awaji‚Äù expansion in Ubisoft‚Äôs
Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows
. It‚Äôs all part of 11 new games joining the
GeForce NOW library
.
Also this week,
Dying Light: The Beast
joins the lineup of GeForce RTX 5080-ready titles, alongside
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II
and
Monster Hunter Wilds
, which are already available on the service. Look for the ‚ÄúGeForce RTX 5080 Ready‚Äù row in the app or check out the
full list
.
Japan is the latest region to get GeForce RTX 5080-class power. Stay tuned to GFN Thursday for updates as more regions upgrade to Blackwell RTX. Those who want to follow along can track progress on the
server rollout page
for the latest.
Japan is live now, with Warsaw and Miami up next.
And don‚Äôt miss out on getting
Borderlands 4
for free
with the purchase of a new 12-month Ultimate membership.
Unleash the Beast
Dying Light: The Beast
is clawing its way into the cloud ‚Äî and it‚Äôs hungry.
Survival of the fastest.
Gamers know the
Dying Light
series isn‚Äôt about taking it easy ‚Äî it‚Äôs about sprinting across rooftops and drop‚Äëkicking zombies in the face to survive the night.
Dying Light: The Beast
cranks that up to 11 with new abilities, terrifying encounters and more ways for players to flex their inner apex predator. New enemy types keep the tension high, creating a world that feels more threatening than ever. Play solo to test survival instincts, or team up in co‚Äëop mode to turn the undead into a highlight reel of creative takedowns.
Players can leap into infected streets, scale rooftops with fluid parkour and battle through relentlessly terrifying nights ‚Äî all without worrying if their gaming rigs can handle the apocalypse. With GeForce NOW, members can stream the chaos across their devices with GeForce RTX 5080-class performance, enabling cinematic visuals, fast load times and ultra‚Äëresponsive gameplay straight from the cloud.
Degrees of Delight
Where learning gets weird.
For gamers who love simulation and strategy games with quirky humor,
Two Point Campus
and the new
Two Point Museum
provide tickets to all the fun. These gems from publisher SEGA put players in charge of building, customizing and running their own campus and museum, filled with eccentric characters and unpredictable events.
In
Two Point Campus
, design sprawling college grounds, hire lively staff, schedule offbeat courses and watch students thrive or chaos unfold. In
Two Point Museum
, curate wild exhibits, draw crowds and manage mishaps while crafting the ultimate cultural destination. Both games blend classic simulation mechanics with fresh, whimsical stories.
Fire them up on GeForce NOW to gain instant access to imaginative worlds, smooth animations and vibrant visuals on any screen, wherever members are.
New Shadows
Claws out.
The latest
Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows
expansion is here, streaming day‚Äëand‚Äëdate on GeForce NOW. The shadows grow sharper in the ‚ÄúClaws of Awaji‚Äù expansion, which takes Assassins to the Awaji Islands, introducing a dangerous enemy faction. Players can dive into a fresh storyline packed with story, challenging contracts and a new set of stealth‚Äëfocused tools that reward creative approaches. The expansion also adds new enemy types, gear and assassination techniques to master, plus side quests that reveal hidden secrets of the region.
