With over 175 games now supporting
NVIDIA DLSS 4
— a suite of advanced, AI-powered neural rendering technologies — gamers and tech enthusiasts everywhere can experience breakthrough performance in this year’s most anticipated titles, including
Borderlands 4
,
Hell Is Us
and
Fate Trigger
.
Plus, path tracing is making its way to
Resident Evil Requiem
and
Directive 8020
, as well as ray tracing in upcoming releases like
Phantom Blade Zero
,
PRAGMATA
and
CINDER CITY
— enabling crystal-clear visuals for more immersive gameplay
“DLSS 4 and path tracing are no longer cutting-edge graphical experiments — they’re the foundation of modern PC gaming titles,” said Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA. “Developers are embracing AI-powered rendering to unlock stunning visuals and massive performance gains, enabling gamers everywhere to experience the future of real-time graphics today.”
These announcements come alongside a new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series bundle for
Borderlands 4
and updates to the
NVIDIA app
— a companion platform for content creators, gamers and AI enthusiasts using NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs.
DLSS 4 Now Accelerating Over 175 Games and Applications
Launched with the GeForce RTX 50 Series earlier this year, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation uses AI to generate up to three frames for every traditionally rendered frame, delivering performance boosts of up to 8x over traditional rendering.
In addition to Multi Frame Generation, DLSS 4 titles include support for DLSS Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction and NVIDIA Reflex technology — unlocking incredible performance gains and responsive gameplay for every GeForce RTX 50 Series owner.
New titles announced at Gamescom that will support the latest RTX technologies include:
Directive 8020
and
Resident Evil Requiem
, which are launching with DLSS 4 and path tracing
Black State
,
CINDER CITY
(formerly
Project LLL
),
Cronos: The New Dawn
,
Dying Light: The Beast
,
Honeycomb: The World Beyond
,
Lost Soul Aside
,
The Outer Worlds 2
,
Phantom Blade Zero
and
PRAGMATA
, which are launching with DLSS 4 and ray tracing
Borderlands 4
and
Fate Trigger
, which are launching with DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,
which in September will add support for RTX Hair, a technology that uses new hardware capabilities in RTX 50 Series GPUs to model hair with greater path-traced detail and realism
Many of these RTX titles will also launch on the
GeForce NOW
cloud gaming platform, including
Borderlands 4, CINDER CITY
(formerly
Project LLL
)
, Hell Is Us
and
The Outer Worlds 2.
NVIDIA App Adds Global DLSS Overrides and Software Updates
The
NVIDIA app
is the essential companion for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU users, simplifying the process of keeping PCs updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio Drivers.
New updates to the NVIDIA app include:
Global DLSS Overrides:
Easily enable DLSS Multi-Frame Generation or DLSS Super Resolution profiles globally across hundreds of DLSS Override titles, instead of needing to configure per title.
Project G-Assist Upgrades:
The latest update to Project G-Assist — an on-device AI assistant that lets users control and tune their RTX systems with voice and text commands — introduces a significantly more efficient AI model that uses 40% less memory. Despite its smaller footprint, it responds to queries faster and more accurately calls the right tools.
Highly Requested Legacy 3D Settings:
Use easily configurable control panel settings — including anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion — to enhance classic games.
The NVIDIA app beta update launches Tuesday, Aug. 19, at 9 a.m. PT, with full availability coming the following week.
NVIDIA ACE Enhances Voice-Driven Gaming Experiences
NVIDIA ACE
— a suite of generative AI technologies that power lifelike non-playable character interactions in games like Krafton’s
inZOI
— now features in Iconic Interactive’s
The Oversight Bureau
, a darkly comic, voice-driven puzzle game.
Using speech-to-text technology powered by ACE, players can interact naturally with in-game characters using speech, with Iconic’s Narrative Engine interpreting the input and determining and delivering the pre-recorded character dialogue that best fits the story and situation.
This system keeps developers in creative control while offering players real agency in games — all running locally on RTX AI PCs with sub-second latency.
The Oversight Bureau
launches later this year and will be playable at NVIDIA’s Gamescom B2B press suite.
NVIDIA RTX Remix Evolves With Community Expansions and New Particle System
NVIDIA RTX Remix
, an open-source modding platform for remastering classic games with path tracing and neural rendering, continues to grow thanks to its passionate community.
Modders have been using large language models to extend RTX Remix’s capabilities. For example, one modder “vibe coded” a plug-in that connects RTX Remix to Adobe Substance 3D, the industry-standard tool for 3D texturing and materials. Another modder made it possible for RTX Remix to use classic game data to instantly make objects glow with emissive effects.
RTX Remix’s open-source community has even expanded compatibility to allow many new titles to be remastered, including iconic games like
Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
,
Knights Of The Old Republic
,
Doom 3
,
Half-Life: Black Mesa
and
Bioshock.
Some of these games were featured in the RTX Remix’s $50K Mod Contest, which wrapped up at Gamescom.
Painkiller RTX
by Merry Pencil Studios won numerous awards, including “Best Overall RTX Remix Mod.” Explore all mod submissions on
ModDB.com
.
At Gamescom, NVIDIA also unveiled a new RTX Remix particle system that brings dynamic, realistically lit and physically accurate particles to 165 classic games — the majority of which have never had a particle editor.
Modders can use the system to change the look, size, quantity, light emission, turbulence and even gravity of particles in games. The new particle system will be available in September.
‘Borderlands 4’ GeForce RTX 50 Series Bundle Available Now
