To foster such innovation, the
NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship Program
provides grants, mentors and technical support to doctoral students doing outstanding research relevant to NVIDIA technologies. The program, in its 25th year, is now accepting applications worldwide.
It focuses on supporting students working in AI, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, computer graphics, robotics, healthcare, high-performance computing and related fields. Awards are up to $60,000 per student.
Since its start in 2002, the Graduate Fellowship Program has awarded over 200 grants worth more than $7.3 million.
Students must have completed at least their first year of Ph.D.-level studies at the time of application.
The application deadline for the 2026-2027 academic year is Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. An in-person internship at an NVIDIA research office preceding the fellowship year is mandatory; eligible candidates must be available for the internship in summer 2026.
