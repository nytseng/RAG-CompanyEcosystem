War Waits for No Respawn
Turn cover into rubble ‚Äî and rubble into cover.
Battlefield
6 drops gamers into all-out warfare, where every shot and explosion can change the tide of the fight.
With a new Kinesthetic Combat System, in-game movements and gunplay feel sharper and more instinctive than ever. Battle through Conquest and Breakthrough modes or a global campaign spanning Cairo to Gibraltar. The Phantom Edition packs exclusive skins, weapons, vehicle cosmetics and a Battle Pass so gamers are geared up from day one.
When every second counts, GeForce NOW puts players in control with ultralow-latency streaming and razor-sharp frames ‚Äî whether dodging artillery or rocketing off a grenade mid-air. Stream at up to 240 frames per second (fps) from almost any device and take the fight anywhere when
Battlefield 6
joins the cloud at launch.
Ready, Set, Click
From chat to combat ‚Äî instantly.
NVIDIA and Discord have teamed up to change how people discover and play games together, making it easier than ever for friends and communities to stay connected. Powered by GeForce NOW, the new integrated experience ‚Äî
first shown at Gamescom
‚Äî lets anyone discover and try games like
Fortnite
directly on Discord with no downloads or installs needed, and even without a GeForce NOW membership.
This next-level experience is fueled by a limited-time trial of the GeForce NOW Performance tier, letting anyone jump into streaming at up to 1440p and 60 fps ‚Äî all without ever leaving Discord. For Discord‚Äôs hundreds of millions of users, it‚Äôs a fast, simple way to play together and keep the gaming conversation going, right where it‚Äôs already happening.
The first playable game with this integration is
Fortnite
, rolling out to gamers now. A single click on a Discord chat link and an Epic Games account login are all it takes to join the action. The integration opens a new way to discover and play games, enabling publishers to create smooth gaming experiences for communities everywhere.
Wander Where You Want To
Adventure awaits.
Bethesda‚Äôs
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition
is the single-player role-playing game that defined open-world fantasy adventures. This edition bundles the original
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
with its celebrated expansions, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, delivering the definitive version of the iconic game.
Step into a rich world where every choice shapes destiny. Take on the epic quest to save Morrowind from a terrible blight, or carve a path across vast landscapes filled with ancient cities, dangerous dungeons and curious creatures.
With the expansions, visit the mystical Clockwork City, brave frozen Solstheim, clash with werewolves and direct the rise of a mining colony, enjoying up to 80 hours of quests and stories. The game‚Äôs open-ended structure lets players build any character imaginable, offering unmatched depth and replayability.
Jump into the world of Vvardenfell on nearly any device with GeForce NOW, from laptops and Macs to phones and TVs, and pick the adventure back up anytime, anywhere.
Meaty New Games
We got the meats.
King of Meat
is a wild and over-the-top brawler that doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously ‚Äî except when it comes to juicy combos and meaty takedowns. Part cooking show, part gladiator arena, it throws players into chaotic battles where the weapon of choice is meat. Whether tenderizing foes with a ham hock or unleashing absurd special moves, players can lean hard into the game‚Äôs goofy, carnivorous charm. It‚Äôs fast, silly and unashamedly over-seasoned fun.

Deathground
