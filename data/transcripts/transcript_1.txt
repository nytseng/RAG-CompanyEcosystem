BECKY QUICK: Global spending on AI is projected to reach nearly one and a half trillion dollars this year, and it could top $2 trillion in 2026 joining us right now is one of, if not the, key player that’s been driving innovation in the field, Jensen Huang. He is the CEO of Nvidia. It’s got a market cap of four and a half trillion dollars. Makes it the world’s most valuable company, and Jensen, it is a plan. A pleasure to have you here on set. 

JENSEN HUANG: So happy to be here nice to see you.

QUICK: Not as happy as we are. Thank you for coming in today. It’s great to see you. There are so many things that I’d like to talk to you about, because it seems like every day there is this huge fire hydrant of news that’s all about AI, and your company is at the center of most of that news. So if you don’t mind, maybe we can just run through some of these headlines and you can explain what’s happening from your perspective.

HUANG:  I’d love to.

QUICK: Okay, let’s start with the deal that you cut first with Open AI, that you’ve talked a lot about, that was then followed up by this deal earlier this week with AMD and Open AI. A lot of people trying to figure out what the dynamics are of this industry. What do you think about it? Did you know about that deal before it was announced?

HUANG: Not really, but our deal is very different than theirs. We’ve been working with Open AI through Azure, Microsoft and OCI and Core Weave and so through third parties for quite a long time. In fact, in 2016 I delivered the world’s very first AI supercomputer called DGX one, to a startup, a nonprofit startup, in San Francisco, and that company turned out to have been Open AI, and so we’ve been working with them for quite a long time. The Open AI partnership is an addition to what we’re already doing with them on the cloud, all of the cloud contracts, we’re going to continue to execute on all that, but our partnership with them is quite unique in the sense that this is the first time we’re going to sell directly to them. Until then, until now, we’ve been largely selling. We’re only selling through the clouds, and so we’re going to keep doing that. But the thing that’s really exciting is that now by selling directly to them, we could help prepare them for a day when they’re self hosted hyperscaler, and our agreement basically entails selling entire systems and infrastructure to them. You know, we’re the only company in the world today that really focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure, from CPUs to GPUs to networking chips and switches of all kinds, and all the software stacks that go along with that. And so as we’re quite a unique partner for them to be able to do this.

QUICK: I guess the question becomes, it’s great for you to sell the directly to them, but they don’t have the money to buy is, that’s why the deal was structured the way it is, where you’ll get a stake in Open AI over time?

HUANG: not they don’t have the money yet, and the way that that it’s going to it’s going to happen for every gigawatt of AI factories, you’re probably going to need about $50 to $60 billion but a land powered shell, and all the computing and networking and all that, you know, everything that goes along with that, and they’re going to have to, they’re going to have to raise that money through first of all the revenues, which is growing exponentially, equity or debt and they gave us the opportunity to invest alongside other investors when the time comes. And so it’s not something we have to do, but it’s something that that they’re giving us the the opportunity to do, and I would love to do, you know, one of the things that that we did, we invested in Open AI, early on, my only regret is that we didn’t invest more. I mean, this is, this is the most profitable, well, the most valuable startup company ever. And so this is a great opportunity.

QUICK: You mentioned that your deal is very different from AMD. AMD is in a situation where they’re basically giving away a big chunk of their company to be able to be a partner with open AI and sell them some of their goods. Is that how you read it?

HUANG: I saw the deal. It’s, it’s imaginative, it’s, it’s unique and surprising, considering they were so excited about their next generation product, I’m surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it. And so anyhow, it’s, it’s a clever I guess.

QUICK: Yeah, I wondered the same thing. And Lisa Su who, by the way, is a distant cousin of yours right.

HUANG: Yes. She’s terrific.

QUICK: The way they’ve set this up, though, of giving it away, they’re also making some big assumptions that their chips are going to be able to compete with your chips that are coming out down the road. Do you think that’s the case?

HUANG: Well, you know, our chips are quite special, and we’re running really fast. We’re the only company in the world today that that builds all of the chips inside an AI infrastructure, and today, back when we first started, five years ago, even an ampere chip or a hopper chip is just one chip. Today, if you want to build one of these AI supercomputers, it takes a whole bunch of different types of chips that get the performance out of it, because, you know, Moore’s law, the transistor itself is really slowing down, and we want to create those x factors of performance increase every single year, and we’re delivering these new systems every single year, and every year is multiple times faster than the last generation. In order for us to do that, we have to optimize the entire AI infrastructure that supercomputers is the most complex computer the world’s ever made, and we optimize across all of that design new chips every year, so one chip alone is not probably going to be able to deliver the type of results we do and but anyways, they’re really good company, and we take them very seriously, and we just kind of to keep running fast.

QUICK: Let’s talk about vendor financing, because that has been something that has raised a lot of questions on Wall Street since you cut this deal with Open AI yesterday, Bloomberg is reporting that you have a $2 billion in financing that you’re going to be involved with xAI to help them with these same stories. But this idea of circular financing, your customers can’t afford to buy these chips yet, so you’re going to help them out with money along the way. That leads some people to think back to what happened with companies during the big build up like a Lucent or a Nortel in the early days. Is this different? And if so, how?

HUANG: Well, first of all, xAI, I’m super excited about the financing opportunity that they’re doing. You know, the only, the only regret I have about xAI, we’re an investor already that the only regret I have is I didn’t give him more money. You know, almost everything that Elon is part of, you really want to be part of as well. And, and he gave us the opportunity to invest in xAI I’m just delighted by that. And so that’s not, that’s an investment into a really great future company. And I’m really excited about that. That’s not vendor financing, per se. But what’s going on, what’s going on in world versus what happened in 2000 is just dramatically different. You know, back then, as you recall, there were Pets.com, Hospitals.com and the all of the internet companies combined was what 30, $40 billion in size. If you look at the hyperscalers now, that’s where the first tranche of AI infrastructure is building. If you look at the AI, the hyperscalers, that about two and a half trillion dollars of business that’s already operating today. That business, that two and a half trillion dollar business, and the capex that goes underneath that is about, call it, $500 billion that transition from a classical CPU based computing to now generative AI computing powered by GPUs. That transition is just starting, so we’ve got to build into half a trillion dollars worth of capacity infrastructure that’s already naturally growing by itself, and we’re in the beginning phases of that work. If you just look at envious AI infrastructure business, you know, call it a couple of 100 billion dollars. So far, it were a couple 100 billion dollars into a multi trillion dollar build out. So that’s number one. The second part of it that’s really unique is that we have a new generation of AI companies, the new AI companies like Open AI and Anthropic and xAI, and companies that are that are, well, you know, thinking machine labs from Miura and IIya’s SSI and Misha’s company, Reflection and, I mean, there’s a whole bunch of amazing AI model builders. Now, this generation of AI model builders, what’s happened in the last several months? A transition happened that is really, really important. For the last several years, they’ve been generating tokens, you know, these AI tokens basically at a loss. And the reason for that is because the early AI models weren’t they were super interesting, really captivate a lot of attention, but they weren’t useful enough to pay for the last several months has been very clear that the new technology is now reasoning. It’s doing research before it answers a question. It goes on the web and studies other PDFs and websites, it can now use tools, generate information for you, and it creates responses that are really useful. I use it every day, to the point where now the tokens are profitable.

QUICK: The question though is, who is going to continue to pay for that build up? Is it big companies like Procter and Gamble? Is it a big is it consumers who are going to do this? I mean, my doctor showed me the AI that he’s using, and it’s incredibly helpful, but there’s still a question about whether he’s going to pay for it, or the company works for is going to pay for it?

HUANG: Well, hopefully both, I think the there’s the consumer part of it. You know, a lot of OpenAI customers are consumers, and they’re paying for it. But the thing that’s really cool is that the Enterprise AI build out that’s happening now my my favorite enterprise AI service is Cursor. Cursor is an AI coder, and every one of our engineers, 100% is now assisted by AI coders, and our productivity has gone up incredibly. And so you’re now seeing enterprise AI companies like Cursor, OpenEvidence, I love Lovable all of these companies are some of the fastest growing companies in the world, and they address enterprise. And so enterprise AI is here.

MICHAEL SANTOLI: I wonder how you think about, Jensen, the ultimate destination where all this is actually building toward. I don’t know. There was a post from David Cahn, who’s a Sequoia partner, this week saying, look, AGI is the only thing that can justify the volumes of capital spending right now, Artificial General Intelligence. At the same time, many of the model builders and experts are pushing out the date where that maybe is going to be achievable. Meantime, you think about annual generations of chips. How fast do they depreciate? We’re putting all this capital in these data centers that it’s just not clear, like when we get to the end, or is it just a treadmill?

HUANG: We are going to have incredibly profitable and incredibly useful AIs, long before AGI, and for example, right now, Cursor AI, Cursor. Cursor, Cursor is AI software coder. Is incredibly useful. All of our engineers use it. We have some 40,000 engineers. Almost every one of them are going to use it, and they’re they’re loving it.

SANTOLI: You’re using it instead of something else, presumably, right? So these are displacing things.

HUANG: Yeah, they’re not, this is a brand new thing.

SANTOLI: Yeah.

HUANG: Remember AI unlike, unlike previous technologies, previous technologies are tools that humans use. Excel is a tool that humans use. A web browser, it’s a tool that humans use. For the very first time, we have technology that can actually use tools by itself. And so Cursor uses, you know, Visual C++ and now we have Gemini agents that are able to use the browser and browse, browse for for groceries or, you know, destinations, or book travel for you and and it can use travel. It can use tools by itself. So, so this is really quite an extraordinary thing. This tool users, the tool industry is a few trillion dollars. Tool user industry is $100 trillion which is the reason why everybody’s so excited about the future of technology because it could augment labor, it can increase the productivity of labor. And here at Nvidia, you know, it’s increased our productivity tremendously.

SANTOLI: You’ve already said you wish you could have bought more OpenAI and maybe invested more in xAI at this point, that implies that you don’t think that this is all redundant. Because a lot of the players, I mean, if I read what Sam Altman says and the message he tries to convey, it’s as if they’re sprinting to try to stay ahead of everybody else because they think it’s not going to be room for everybody necessarily who’s trying to do something similar.

HUANG: I think there’s general intelligence and I think there’s specialized intelligence.

SANTOLI: Yeah.

HUANG: We love general when I hire engineers, I like them to be generally intelligent, and that’s that’s a great thing. But once they come to Nvidia, we make them highly specialized intelligent so that they could build things that you know, Nvidia needs. And so I think the idea of specialized intelligence versus generalized intelligence will continue to happen, and where the real value for enterprises and companies are is specialized intelligence, and where the value for consumers, general intelligence.

QUICK: Hey Jensen, let’s talk a little bit about capital allocation. And how do you see that? Just back to those same points that you wish you had more invested in OpenAI, you wish you had more invested in in these other companies that you’re kind of taking stakes in, like an xAI, you can do things with your money. You can choose to put it back into R&D. You probably don’t need a ton with that right now. You can choose to build the company. You can choose to make acquisitions. You can choose to give shareholders back big dividends, or you can invest it yourself in other companies. And lately, what we’ve seen is a lot of investing in other companies. Do you have other deals like that planned in the works?

HUANG: We’re always looking for great startups to invest in. One of my favorite ones was CoreWeave.

QUICK: Right.

HUANG: My only regret is I didn’t invest enough. And so in all of these, all of these investments that we’ve made recently, we’ve made some really terrific investments and and largely, my only regret is that we didn’t invent invest more because you’re really special companies, and they’re building, they’re part of our ecosystem, building out the AI infrastructure for the world. And AI is several things. AI is energy, AI is chips, the models and the applications. And so you could see Nvidia, and you could look at me working across that entire stack of ecosystems around the world. And we need more energy. We need more chips, we need better models and more models, and we need a lot more applications.

QUICK: So what of your cash flow that you kick off, and Mike, I knew you ran the numbers, what is it?

SANTOLI: I was just looking at the consensus like 240 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year, and next is what—

QUICK: So that’s a lot of cash that you can choose to set to work. Do you look for other investments within the AI infrastructure? Do you look for ways to build out extra energy? Do you look for somebody in quantum computing to get to the next thing that you could buy? What’s in your brain at this point?

HUANG: All of that, I’m excited about, Enterprise AI applications, and if, if I were to realize that the Cursor team was raising money before, I would have given them all of my money. And so this is really terrific stuff. I’m excited about the work that that Open Evidence is doing in helping digital nurses and digital hos— with diagnosis. I’m excited about the work that Figure is doing in robotics. Wayve is doing with self-driving cars. Waabi is doing in self-driving cars. And so there’s just a, an incredibly large set of new companies that are enabled by this revolutionary technology called AI. And so, these new companies are going to be future giants, and it would be great to be part of them, support their growth. And be part of that, part of that journey.

QUICK: There was an analyst who was on our program earlier this week, maybe it was late last week, who said, after the OpenAI deal, they wondered how long it would take for the antitrust authorities to come looking at Nvidia. I didn’t quite understand that, dug into it a little bit. Reuters has put out something just saying that as all these big, big giants in the AI development world kind of team up and partner, it does raise questions about whether it shuts out new entrants. What’s, what’s your response to that, what do you say?

HUANG: All of these deals have to be done in a way that that is fair to others, doesn’t, doesn’t foreclose markets, and is not exclusive. And so, the investment that we make in OpenAI, we don’t make it a requirement that they use that investment to buy Nvidia’s technology. They can use it to do anything they like.

QUICK: And maybe the AMD deal that was, that came just on the heels of that kind of proves that out that it is not a single partnership.

HUANG: That’s right. There are no exclusivities. The goal is to advance the AI infrastructure, support their success, and in many of these cases, you know, they’d be part of that incredible journey for us and and it’s great returns on our money, of course, but our primary goal is just really to support them and help them grow and grow the AI ecosystem.

QUICK: What, what, again, you were surprised by the AMD deal, but you look at it very differently. Does, do you think as a competitive structure here this puts like any pressure on anything that comes through? What do you—

HUANG: I don’t think has really anything to do with with it won’t affect anything that we do. I think our primary focus, our strategy number one is to create a platform that increases performance, or another way of thinking about it, reduces token generation cost by very significant margins every single year. Now, of course, that pace of innovation puts pressure on the entire industry, you know, all of our competitors and so on, but everybody benefits when we drive the cost of tokens down every single year. Between Hopper, between Blackwell and Hopper, we’re going to drive down the cost of tokens 10 to 20 times. And so that’s another, Moore’s law, transistors alone would have driven it down by 20% so instead of 20%, it’s 20 times. And we do that again and again and again every single year. We could do it because we change every single chip in the data center. We change every single technology all once. And so my focus and the company’s focus is just to keep that pace going. And when we keep that pace going, the ecosystem around us, when the token generation continues to decrease, the AIs get smarter, and when the AIs get smarter, we can use it for more applications and we can drive more productivity into the economy. The economy grows. You know, everything, everything gets better.

SANTOLI: When the AIs do get smarter, is that going to mark a transition away from just the hyper intensive, physical capital building part of this, where hardware is the entire, you know, the entire game in a sense, right? I mean, it’s an interesting thing. When I look at how the Metas and the Microsofts and the Alphabets were looked at a few years ago, oh, they’re asset light. They don’t have to reinvest in their businesses. They have massive free cash flow. And now it’s about actually creating physical assets that are going to be productive down the road—

HUANG: In order to—

SANTOLI: Do we get to a point where it’s like now we reap?

HUANG: No and the reason for that is because forever, AI is going to be about thinking. And in order to think in real time, to understand the question, understand the context, maybe go do some reading and research on the internet. That thinking process requires a computer. That’s the reason why I say there’s a new industry. We’ve created a brand-new industry called AI infrastructure. And these infrastructures will be like the electricity infrastructure, the internet infrastructure, and this will be permanent infrastructure for society, every society, and so this is, this is a transform, transformative time. And the way we deliver computers in the future, the way we deliver intelligence and produce intelligence is fundamentally different. The thing that you mentioned, which is really interesting is, when you look across the stack, when I said earlier, AI is energy, it’s chips, it’s infrastructure, it’s AI models, and it’s AI application. And in just one conversation, we’ve already identified that energy industry is growing, the chips industry, for example, us, we’re growing. Infrastructure, Azure, OCI, AWS, CoreWeave, Nebius, these incredible companies. They’re growing. AI models, OpenAI, Anthropic, x, they’re growing. And on top of that, AI applications, Cursor, Open Evidence, isn’t that right? We’re literally seeing a compute complete revolution across that entire stack, and opportunities across it. And to the extent that we have the financial capacity to do so and to be part of this ecosystem, this entire stack, we’re going to participate across that entire stack.

QUICK: Jensen, you’re not only looking at technological advances and thinking about how to do that, how to build this infrastructure. You have to be thinking about risks all the time too. What’s at the top of your list in terms of risk assessments when you’re looking at these things that pose a risk, pose a threat to the growth that you’re talking about.

HUANG: Well, there’s a lot of technology risk and there’s a lot of product design risk. There’s a lot of those kind of things, but those kind of things are things we’re good at. You know, fundamentally, our company is good at building technology and building products, and so we’re good at those things, and we can continue to be careful and thoughtful about doing those things. The things that are hard for us, that are new for us are a geopolitical risk, and it’s out of our control and and the best thing that we could do is just inform, inform policymakers and governments about the nature of AI, why it’s different than previous technologies, to be accessible to them, to be to be informative to them, and then help them, help them shape policies that are in the best interest of the world, the best interest of the countries.

QUICK: So how far ahead of China do you think we are in terms of AI development at this point?

HUANG: Depending on which layer of the stack, but overall, I would say we’re not far ahead. If you look at the entire stack, they’re way ahead on energy. I am so happy that President Trump leaned into pro growth, pro energy growth, so that an entire industry above it could grow. If you could just imagine, without President Trump’s pro energy policy, that entire layer above the energy would have been constrained. China is well ahead of us on energy. We are way ahead on chips. They’re right there on infrastructure. They’re right there on AI models. We – our models are better overall. OpenAI’s is better. Anthropic’s is better. Gemini’s better. However, their open source models are well ahead of us. And then on the application layer, we have to be quite mindful, because their applications are very fast moving. Their society is very quick in adopting new technology. They’re under regulated. They don’t regulate heavily at the industrial level. And so the applications in China are advancing incredibly fast. This is an area that I’m quite concerned about. I hope that American companies and American society are going to be fast in adopting AI applications, because ultimately this industrial revolution wins at the AI application layer, at the diffusion layer.

QUICK: There was an analyst just this week who said that he’s anticipating China will get NVIDIA’s Blackwell chips by as early as next year. Do you think that’s the case? If we are way ahead of them in chips, what should our strategy be, to give them better chips, or risk having them build their own chips that are better? But if we are – if we hold the advantage here, how do we as Americans think about this?

HUANG: That’s right. This isn’t where a nuanced strategy is necessary. We have to take a step back. President Trump had an AI Action Plan Day. And at AI Action Plan Day, he was very clear, and is a very thoughtful and very, very –  America win around the world strategy. Ultimately, he wants America to win the AI race. So the question when you take a step back and ask yourself, what does that mean? At the chip level, you want to have the most advanced chips. We want to make sure that United States and American allies have the most advanced access to the most advanced AI chips. On the other hand, in order for AI to – in order to win the AI race, you need to have all of the world’s AI developers to be building on your platform, just as we would if you’re an app store, you would like all the apps to run on your app store. If you’re an operating system, you would like all of your – all the world’s applications to run on your operating system. If you were a chip, an American tech stack, you want all of the world’s AI developers to be developing on your American tech stack. That’s true whether we’re here in United States or whether it’s developers in China. And so, this nuance –

QUICK: But from a defense perspective, we don’t want them having the chips that are as great as we are, because we don’t want them having access to that, particularly when it comes to the military.

HUANG: No government, surely, Chinese government, is going to be building their defense on Western technology. Nor does the Pentagon use Chinese chips to build our national security. And so, they have plenty of chips themselves. Don’t forget that this is a country not without any chips. They have Huawei. They have really, really sophisticated and really entrepreneurial startups building AI chips. They’re manufacturing lots of chips. And so the fact of the matter is, their military has plenty access to their own chips. What we need to do is find a nuanced strategy that allows the United States to stay ahead, but for American tech stacks to be used all over the world, so that the world builds on the American standard.

SANTOLI: Are we on the way to being that global standard? I mean, you keep hearing about sovereign AI, and it seems as if there are these interests in creating parallel kind of AI ecosystems.

HUANG: If we don’t win around the world, someone else – if we preclude other people from building on the American tech stack, they’ll have to use some other stack. I think David Sacks had a really simple KPI. He said, In five years time, if America – the American tech stack is 80% of the world, then we are doing a good job winning the AI race. If the United States is 20% of the percent of the world, then we’ve lost the AI race. Now, one of the things that’s really important is that developers are all over the world. 50% of the world’s AI researchers are in China. China is 30% of the – of the technology industry, technology market. The Chinese market is large. They’ve got a billion users. And so it’s not a market that you could easily decide to walk away from if your ultimate goal is for America to win the AI race. Giving up 30% of the world’s market right from the get-go, and then not allowing American technologies to diffuse and be proliferated around the world, we are essentially isolating American technology into America and forfeiting and conceding the rest of the world to everybody else. And I think President Trump would say that that would be not a condition for America to win the AI race. And so, we have to find a nuanced strategy that allows America to have the best technology, earliest technology, but also to win AI developers around the world and win AI markets around the world.

QUICK: I think you also want to be bringing in and working with the best talent. And to that point, you put out a note, a memo to your employees yesterday about the H-1B visas and the new government requirement that it’s going to cost $100,000 on top of it to bring someone in from China or from India or from elsewhere. What is your policy with that? What do you think of this new step in it? I know you’ve said that you’re going to step up and go ahead and pay those to bring people in.

HUANG: Immigration – I’m an immigrant, immigration, and –

QUICK: And we’re very glad to have you here.

HUANG: Thank you. Immigration is the foundation of the American dream. This ideal that anyone can come to America and through hard work and some talent, be able to build a better future for yourself. My parents came here because of the American dream and wanting us to be able to enjoy the opportunities and this incredible country that is America. And I think this ideal, and this dream is common around the world. Only America has a word – a phrase that says the American dream. There’s no other country that has something other, you know, some other country dream. And so, we would like to create this opportunity for all of our employees and I hope that this opportunity persists for everybody else. I do think that President Trump’s H-1B policy enables us to continue to attract the world’s best talent and enable them to come to American companies. And for all of these foreign students who come to United States, gets an American – gets an incredible American degree – one of the best educations in the world – to create the conditions by which we can have them stay. I think it’s a first step. There are things that I would love to see that enhances the policy so that there’s still some opportunities for serendipity to happen. For example, I don’t think that my family would have been able to afford the $100,000 and so the opportunity for my family and for me to be here would have been –  would not have been possible with this current policy. And so, I’m hoping that there will be enhancements to it. And I think this is just the first step, and President Trump is always pragmatic. And, you know, I think that it will be enhanced over time. But this is a nice improvement.

SANTOLI: We mentioned, just quickly, $4.5 trillion market cap. Your employees created that value and are also beneficiaries of that value. How do you run a business and maintain a culture when so many of your employees have done so well financially and keep them motivated and such?

QUICK: Yeah, half of your employees have a net worth of more than a million dollars, and I think 75% – or 75% are over a million. Half of them are over 25 million.

HUANG: Yeah, and I’m so happy about that. I get so many emails with them, you know, people saying I just bought a house, or I just bought my family or my parents a house, or put my kids through school and I just love that. The way you do that is to stay focused on the purpose of the company, the work, the important work that we’re doing. You know, ultimately, my job is to create the conditions by which amazing people could do their life’s work. And this turns out, for most people who are doing their lives work, the money is, as you know, is a symptom of doing that work well. It’s not the purpose of the work. And so, so long as the purpose of the work remains the same for me, for example, I’ve been working hard for a long time and it’s been a long time since I’ve had to work, but I love the opportunity to be able to do work. And the company’s in a place now where the work that we do could be really quite consequential for the world. We’ve been building impactful technology that could revolutionize and transform just about every industry and every society. And so, this is a time that none of us want to give up on. And so, this is such a great, great opportunity for us.

QUICK: Can I ask you quickly about electricity? We’ve mentioned that several times. There was a Bloomberg report just in the last week or so that just said wholesale electricity prices are up by as much as 267% in areas that are new – near new data centers that have been built. That those costs are getting passed on to average consumers. First of all, do you think that’s true? And second of all, what do we do about it?

HUANG: I’m not sure that’s true. I’m not sure if it’s true or not, but what we should do about it is to invest in power generation behind the meter. And President Trump has really created the conditions by which we could go and do that and all become power generation companies ourselves. And so, these data centers should be outfitted with power generation capabilities, whether it’s natural gas or in the future, several years from now, nuclear. We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy. And then even, you know, put it back onto the grid. And so that’s the future. And data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid. And we have to do that. We have to do – we have to apply every possible form.

QUICK: Jensen, anything you wanted to talk about that you feel like you haven’t gotten the chance to talk about? You get people asking you questions all the time. What do you not get to talk about?

HUANG: Well, let’s see. What do we –

SANTOLI: What do investors most want to know from you, I guess?

HUANG: Investors. I would say the thing that is even quite surprising, this year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially. And this is what’s happened. Because AI went from simple, one shot answers to these reasoning and thinking AI, the results are so good, but it uses exponential amounts of computing. But the interesting thing is, because they’re so good, because they’re so smart, and they use exponential amounts of computing, we’re seeing exponential demand, which makes sense, because the AIs are smart enough that everybody wants to use it. And so, we now have two exponentials happening at the same time. Demand for Blackwell is really, really high, and we’re trying, we’re working hard to get everybody online, and, you know, get AI to the next level. But I think we’re at the beginning of a new build out, beginning of a new industrial revolution, and it’s going to be exciting times.

QUICK: Jensen, we want to thank you very much for being with us this morning and being on set, it’s really great to see you.

HUANG: Thank you so much.
