# NVIDIA Jensen Huang 2025 Transcripts README

## Overview
This contains transcript metadata for interviews, podcasts, and public appearances featuring **Jensen Huang**, the CEO and Co-Founder of NVIDIA.  

Transcripts are restricted to the **year of 2025** to ensure relevance and consistency, since discussions around the AI industry evolves rapidly.

Transcripts are included only if the dialogue includes proper **speaker attribution**. That means the transcript explicitly identifies who is speaking (e.g., “HUANG:”, “JENSEN HUANG:”). This ensures that words spoken by Jensen Huang are accurately attributed to him, avoiding ambiguity. 

While these requirements significantly reduces the total number of available transcripts (since many automatically generated YouTube transcripts lack speaker tagging), it improves the data's overall quality.

## Metadata Structure
Each transcript is represented as a JSON object within an array. The metadata for every transcript is broken into the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **id** | A unique label (e.g., `transcript_1`) used for reference and indexing. |
| **details** | A human-readable description of the source of the interview/podcast/event. |
| **video_link** | A direct URL to where the original video or audio can be found. |
| **date** | The date of the interview, podcast, or event, formatted as `Month Day, 2025`. |
| **source** | The link to the full transcript. |

## Methodology
The collection of these transcripts followed a manual and source-verified approach to ensure completeness, authenticity, and relevance to NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang. The following summarizes the steps taken:

1. **Initial Discovery**
   - Conducted manual searches on Google using queries such as:
     > “latest 2025 Jensen Huang transcripts”  
     > “Jensen Huang interview transcript 2025”  
     > “Jensen Huang podcast transcript 2025”  
   - The search results were reviewed to identify interviews, podcasts, or events involving Jensen Huang.

2. **Screening and Verification Criteria**
   - Each potential source was opened and checked to ensure:
     - The content is from 2025.
     - The video or audio exists and is accessible in some form (e.g., YouTube, podcast platforms, or official network archives).
     - Jensen Huang is an actual participant (not merely mentioned or quoted).
     - The transcript includes speaker attributions.
   - Sources that lacked a video link, used partial AI summaries, or contained ambiguous speakers were **excluded**.

3. **Transcript Acquisition**
   - Once a transcript met the inclusion criteria, the text was manually copied from its source.
   - Each transcript was saved into an individual `.txt` file and labeled sequentially (e.g., `transcript_1.txt`, `transcript_2.txt`, etc.).
   - Metadata such as the source URL, video link, publication date, and description were then compiled into a structured JSON record.

## Additional Notes
- The **length** of each transcript vary significantly. Some are brief interviews, while others are extended keynotes or long-form podcast discussions.  
- **Formatting differences** exist across transcripts. Speaker identifiers for Jensen Huang may appear in several formats, such as:
  - `HUANG:`
  - `JENSEN`
  - `Jensen Huang:`
  - `Jensen (23:01)`
  - or lowercase variants like `jensen:`
